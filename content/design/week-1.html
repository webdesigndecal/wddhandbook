<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>What is <span class=\"design-highlighted-text\">design</span>? Well-designed websites and apps are often called "beautiful", but is that all there is to it? As you'll learn, design is much more than aesthetics, and requires understanding of user cognition, behavior, and needs. 
 </p>

<br/><br/>

<h2>Defining Design</h2>

<p>Design is really about problem solving. How might we make products, services, etc. that serve their purpose in the most effective way possible? Different kinds of design address different aspects of "effectiveness".
</p>

<br/><br/>

<p>We'll be focusing on the following two types of design: </p>

<br/>

<p><span class=\"design-highlighted-text\">User Interface (UI) Design</span> involves the space where interactions between the user and machine occur. This might come in the form of a remote control or navigation through a website. 
</p>

<br/><br/>

<p><span class=\"design-highlighted-text\">User Experience (UX) Design</span> has to do with a person's emotions and attitudes about using a product, system, or service. 
</p>

<br/><br/>

<p>Some other adjacent forms of design include <span class=\"design-highlighted-text\">product design</span> (which is a product-focused approach to UIUX design), <span class=\"design-highlighted-text\">graphic design</span> (creating visuals that convey meaning to viewers, and <span class=\"design-highlighted-text\">industrial design</span> (the physical appearance, functionality, and fabrication of a product). 
</p>

<br/><br/>

<h2>Design Process</h2>

<br/><br/>

<p>
 The <span class=\"design-highlighted-text\">process</span> of reaching your final design is incredibly important for creating high quality products. Let's go through the drafting process for desiging a website.

<br/><br/>

<h3>Low Fidelity</h3>

</div>

<p><span class=\"design-highlighted-text\">Low fidelity wireframes</span> are quick and dirty visuals of the overall layout of the webpage, illustrating over-arching ideas of placement, spacing, and simple interaction. Low fidelity wireframes can be sketched on paper or created through design software. This stage is best for brainstorming and narrowing down what design to develop.
