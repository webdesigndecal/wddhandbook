<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    We understand how to lay things out within our divs and boxes now, but how do we <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">change the position of those actual boxes on our webpage</span>? We use CSS positioning! The position property comes in handle for a lot of special cases where your element needs to be in a very <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">particular position</span> to realize your ideal design. This can get rough if you're not careful, but let's go through the fundamentals so you don't have to make too many mistakes. If it starts getting hard or tedious, push through because your beautiful layout will be worth the trial and many errors.
</p>

<br/><br/>

<h2>Positioning Types</h2>
<p>
    There are <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">four main ways</span> to position things in CSS. All these ways use the CSS <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">position</code> property. The four most common values used for this property are <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">static</code>, <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">relative</code>, <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">absolute</code>, and <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">fixed</code>. The first two positioning types are fairly similar to each other, and the latter two also share similar properties.
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Static and Relative</h3>
<p>
    <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">Static</span> is the <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">default</span> position of things. If you didn't specify a position for the element, it is technically static. It basically means all the elements are where they should be in the flow of the document. Adding <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">relative</span> positioning would mean positioning the element <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">relative to where it would have been</span> in the original flow of the document, relative to its default, static position. This does not take it out of the flow of the document so it's default area will still have space taken up as if the element was there, but you can move around the actual visual element using CSS properties <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">top</code>, <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">left</code>, <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">right</code>, and <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">bottom</code>. The values of these properties can be specified in <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">px</code>, <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">%</code>, or other typical CSS unit values.
</p>
<br/>
<div class=\"content-img-wrapper\">
    <div class=\"multiple-img-wrapper\">
        <img class=\"content-img\" src=\"../../assets/images/position-static.gif\" />
        <img class=\"content-img\" src=\"../../assets/images/position-relative.gif\" />
    </div>

<br/><br/>
<h3>Absolute and Fixed</h3>
<p>
    Absolute and fixed are very similar in that they both take an element out of the flow of the document, unlike static and relative, and can use <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">top</code>, <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">left</code>, <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">right</code>, and <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">bottom</code>. Using these four properties will position th eabsolute or fixed element <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">within the last parent container that also has a position</span>. Because they take the element out of the flow of the page, they don't take up any space on the default first layer of the page. Rather, they overlap all the other elements on a second layer in whatever position you put them in with the <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">top</code>, <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">left</code>, <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">right</code>, and <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">bottom</code> values.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    The <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">difference</span> between absolute and fixed positioning is only one thing. Fixed elements stay in their exact same place relative to the window <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">even when the user scrolls</span>! Think of navigation bars that stay in place as your scroll down the page.
</p>
<br/>
<div class=\"content-img-wrapper\">
    <div class=\"multiple-img-wrapper\">
        <img class=\"content-img\" src=\"../../assets/images/position-absolute.gif\" />
        <img class=\"content-img\" src=\"../../assets/images/position-fixed.gif\" />
    </div>

</div>
<br/><br/>

<h2>The Z-Index Property</h2>
<p>
    Earlier, we talked about how absolute and fixed positioning takes elements out of the flow of the webpage and puts them on another <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">layer</span> above the default one. You may have wondered how we can <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">change</span> what layers these elements are on (or maybe you didn't wonder, but regardless you shall learn). To change the layering, use the CSS property <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">z-index</code>. If one element is <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">z-index: 1</code> and another is <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">z-index: 2</code>, the one with <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">z-index: 2</code> will be on top. Basically, the higher the z-index, the higher the layer the element is on. This is very useful for <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">layering and overlapping</span> different elements in a specific order.
