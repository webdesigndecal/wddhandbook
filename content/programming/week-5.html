<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Understanding how to lay things out with positioning is only the first step to really understanding CSS layouts. Through learning how to <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">center elements</span> on a webpage, we'll learn other methods of laying out elements. Then, we'll delve even deeper, into the modern CSS3 features: <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">flexbox and CSS grids</span>. These amazing features give us all we need to position elements exactly the way we want to, efficiently, without the need for Bootstrap.
</p>

<br/><br/>

<h2>Centering</h2>
<p>
    There are many ways to center things, but here, we will go through three that do not use flexbox or CSS grids. Rather, they will make use of <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">text alignment, margins &amp; padding, positioning, and translation</span>. These are <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">not encouraged</span> to be used in centering in too many cases now that flexbox and grids exist, but they're good to know and help with learning important CSS properties.
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Text Alignment</h3>
<p>
    Counterintuitively, <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">text-align: center</code> is not used only for text. It can be used to horizontally center any element with a <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">display</code> of <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">inline-block</code> or <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">inline</code>. There is also <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">text-align: left</code> and <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">text-align: right</code>, which align inline items to the left or right, as you would expect.
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Margins &amp; Padding</h3>
<p>
    Though this section is about both margins and padding, we will only focus on margins as padding is used in nearly the same way. Margins add a specific about of space between elements. If the <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">same amount of spacing</span> is specified on the left and right, the element will be <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">horizontally centered</span>. If the same amount of spacing is specified on the top and bottom, the element will be <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">vertically centered</span>. For example, if the container was 200 by 200 pixels and a picture (or other content) inside of it was 100 by 100 pixels, adding the style <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">margin: 50px</code>, which adds margins to all sides of the picture, will center the picture horizontally and vertically. Alternatively, <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">margin: 0 auto</code> can be used for horizontally centering an element with a width, height, and display specified inside a parent element with a width and height.
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Positioning</h3>
<p>
    As we saw in the last week, using <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">absolute positioning</span>, we can forcibly position elements exactly where we want them to be. This method of centering would also require <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">pixel or percentage calculations</span>, similar to margins. If we merely position an element absolutely and then add <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">left: 50%</code> and <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">top: 50%</code>, that would make the element <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">off-center</span> as it pushes the <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">edges</span> of the element down and <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">does not use the middle of the element as the point of reference</span> (in other words, the top of the element will have been pushed down 50% with the element itself hanging below the 50% mark).
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    Therefore, if the height and the width of the element is 20% of those of its parent element, we'd have to use <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">top: 40%</code> and <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">left: 40%</code> because we take up 40% of the parent's space on both sides of the elemeent and 20% for the element itself: 40% + 20% + 40% = 100%. Note that these calculations would <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">change yet again</span> and become more <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">complicated</span> if either the child or parent elements <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">had padding or margins</span>, but we won't get into that. With pixels instead of percentages, the concept is the same.
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Translation</h3>
<p>
    To use translation, we'll have to use the <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">transform</code> property of CSS with a value of <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">translateX(amt) translateY(amt)</code>, where <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">amt</code> is replaced with a pixel or percent value. In this case, the <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">midpoint</span> of the element being translated is used instead of the edges like with positioning. So, adding <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">transform: translateX(50%) translateY(50%)</code> does center the element in this case.
</p>

<br/><br/>

<h2>Flexbox</h2>
<p>
    That was a mouthful. All of the above information is a lot to take in, but luckily, if you use flexbox, <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">you won't have to remember most (or any) of it</span>! The name flexbox is derived from \"flexible box\", which is exactly what flexbox provides you with. These flexboxes make it super easy to handle your layouts, <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">without the need to remember a ton</span> of non-English words and rules within rules.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    To use a flexbox, the first thing we have to do is set the display for the element to <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">display: flex</code>.
