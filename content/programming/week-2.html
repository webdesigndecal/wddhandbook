<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    As you saw last week, HTML is all words and boxes surrounded by <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">tags</span>, and uses <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">hierarchy</span> to structure and contain things. If you looked at a webpage that had only HTML, you would see just a bunch of black words on white. It was proably the most basic unpleasant looking website you've ever seen. CSS will give you the power to transform that skeleton into a beauty. Whereas HTML is all tags and hierarchy, CSS is all about <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">selectors</span> and <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">adding properties</span> to different elements. Let's dive in and learn about how to select an element from your HTML and style it.
</p>

<br/><br/>

<h2>HTML Classes and IDs</h2>
<p>
    In order to give your HTML elements, like paragraphs and divs and headers, any style or color, you'll have to select the element. This is usually done using classes and IDs. To add classes and IDs to your HTML, you'll place them in the <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">opening tag</span>. If you've never seen it before, it'll look something like this: for a class, <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">&lt;div class=\"first-class\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> or for an ID, <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">&lt;div id=\"first-div\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    Now, you can't just use them however you want. There's one rule you must remember. Each ID must be unique; the <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">first-div</code> ID can only be used that one time. However, classes can be used as many times as you want, but typically on elements that are similar and would be styled similarly. Think of it this way. Many people can be in <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">first-class</code>, but they're all similar (probably rich). However, to identify them, they'll each have their own unique ID card.
</p>

<br/><br/>

<h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
<p>
    To actually select HTML elements in your CSS file, you'll have to use those classes and IDs as selectors. The typical CSS format is <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">selector { property: value; }</code>. In words, that's a selector followed by curly braces. Within the curly braces are the styles you'd want to give to the element you selected with your selector.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    To select an element with the class <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">first-class</code>, you'll have to put a <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">dot</span> before the class name: <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">.first-class {}</code>. To select an element with the ID <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">first-div</code>, put a <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">pound sign</span> before the ID name: <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">#first-div {}</code>. It is also possible to select every element with a certain tag.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    As a side note, if you wanted to select all divs, it's as simple as <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">div {}</code>. This is not done very often for any tag or element since we don't usually want to style every single div or paragraph or button in exactly the same way on a page. Even if we do want every div (or something else) the same on a simple page, if we add a special div later, it'll have certain styles already in place that might <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">confuse</span> whoever is writing or maintaining the code. Those styles already in place would also then have to be overriden.
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Advanced Selector Use</h3>
<p>
    If you have a firm grasp on selectors, this section will give you even more selection power. Let's go through more selector possibilities. It is possible to select multiple classes at once using a comma: <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">.first-class, .second-class {}</code>. You can also select only elements that have both classes by putting no space between classes: <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">.first-class.second-class {}</code>. To select a child of a certain parent, put only a space between the classes: <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">.parent .child {}</code>. This selects all elements with the class <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">child</code> that have a parent with the class <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">parent</code>.

</p>

<br/><br/>

<h2>CSS Pseudo-class Selectors</h2>
<p>
    There are classes, and there are selectors. Now there are pseudo-class selectors! Pseudo-class selectors are keywords added to your selectors. They tell the CSS to select the HTML element when it is <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">in a certain state</span> of being.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    When we're selecting things normally, we say \"hey CSS file dude, make that paragraph blue when it's in its default state\". With pseudo-selectors, we can style elements when they are in the state of being hovered upon by the user or when it's being clicked by the user. Let's make a blue paragraph green on hover. How you ask? It would look something like this: <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">.text:hover { color: green; }</code>. Now, let's make it turn blue again when hovered: <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">.text:active { color: blue; }</code>. As you can see, we take the selector, add a <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">colon</span>, and then specify the state we want to style.
</p>

<br/><br/>

<h2>Adding CSS Properties</h2>
<p>
    As mentioned earlier, the CSS format is <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">selector { property: value; }</code>. We've got the selectors and pseudoselectors down. Now you're free to actually style those elements by adding properties and values inside the curly braces! There is a pretty good list of CSS properties <a class=\"programming-highlighted-text\" href=\"http://www.htmldog.com/references/css/properties/\">here</a>. See the below code for an example of some common properties. Try pasting the code into into your own HTML or CSS files to see what it looks like!
