<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    We use the internet all the time, are our computers for most of the day, and have a bajillion apps at our fingertips. However, not everyone actually thinks about the <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">foundation that underlies the web</span>. Luckily, you are one of those that are curious enough to take the first step in discovering the amazing world of complexity within websites that bring you your cute cat videos.
</p>

<br/><br/>

<h2>Core Languages</h2>
<p>
    Before we start coding, we have to understand what we're working with. The core languages of the web are <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">HTML, CSS and JS</span>. Let's briefly talk about each one in more depth.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
<span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">HTML</span> is the structure of a website, a barebones skeleton telling the webpage what each thing on the page is. <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">CSS</span> is the design of the website. You give that skeleton some clothes and makeup with CSS, making your elements actually have shape and color and prettiness. Lastly, <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">JavaScript</span> is for function and interactivity. With JS, you can make all your buttons and forms actually do something other than sit there and be pretty.

<div class=\"content-img-wrapper\">

</div>

<h2>Understanding HTML</h2>
<p>
    Though each language is super interesting, we'll concentrate on HTML for the remainder of our time to really get to know the foundation that underlies all the fanciness of websites.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    HTML stands for <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">Hypertext Markup Language</span>. It is really just a bunch of tags you put around your content to tell the browser what each thing is. You can write a ton of text, and it'll display on a webpage with no problem. Humans will likely know that it is a paragraph. However, the browser won't know what it is unless you put a bunch of <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">&lt;p&gt;</code> tags around it, telling it that all of that text is part of a paragraph.
</p>

<br/><br/>

<h2>HTML Tags</h2>

<p>
    Let's go further into the topic of <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">tags</span>, which are necessary to understand pretty much anything else. The earlier example of a paragraph tag would actually not be so lonely. In HTML, it'd look like this: <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>. As you can see, it is a pair of tags. The first of the pair is the <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">opening tag</span> and the last is the <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">closing tag</span>, which must have a forward slash after the bracket. There are many, many tags in HTML and each one marks a different thing. You might want to tell the browser what thing is a header or nav or footer or link or button. There are tags for each of those that are easily Google-able. See a fairly comprehensive list <a class=\"programming-highlighted-text\" href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp\">here</a>.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    Though there are a lot of tags, the most important are probably <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">&lt;head&gt;</code>, <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">&lt;body&gt;</code>, and <code class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">&lt;div&gt;</code>.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    The <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">head</span> is where you put the <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">title</span> of the website, not the one that shows up on the page, but the one that goes on your browser's little tab. It is where you <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">link to your CSS and JS files and fonts</span>.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    The <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">body</span> is for everything else, the <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">site's actual content</span>.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    The <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">div</span> tag is for div-iding up your content into boxes. It can wrap any content with an invisible box. They don't really mean anything, but can really help with structure, hierarchy, and as you'll later learn, styling.
</p>

<br/><br/>

<h2>Hierarchies</h2>

<p>
    In HTML, there is a <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">parent-child</span> hierarchy. You don't want to misunderstand this section because it is a fundamental part of HTML and of structuring websites. So, you know how each tag comes in pairs and has an opening and closing tag? Well, it turns out you can <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">put other tags between those opening and closing tags</span>. The tags that you put inside would be the <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">children</span> of those outer tags, and the outer tags, in turn, would be the <span class=\"programming-highlighted-text\">parents</span> of the inner tags.
